Good Morning,

It's been a really while since I wrote on my terrace, under the foggy sky, with the mild sub-beams kissing my cold hands and the musing chirping of these little birds. Primarily because I was out of town for the majority of my time. And secondly, because it's winter and coming here is a task in itself. The sun's rays are getting stronger with each minute, and the heat of these rays is perfectly complementing the coldness of my hands. The sound of just birds moving their feathers and no humans around. I love it.
 
Reminds me of the lockdown period when this was part of my routine. At that time, the number of birds around was several times higher than today. I visually remember birds chirping around my window, which used to be my alarm. And they never forget to wake me up. They sang beautiful songs for me while chilling with their friends. These little birds are always ecstatic, it seems. Back then, I was observing their chirping, and it felt to me that the vibrations of chirping were at perfect numbers: loud enough to make you listen and calm enough to make your day. I am really enjoying this.
 
I have always been a morning guy. For just two days in the entire history of my life, I have not slept at all. Otherwise, I will go to sleep at a reasonable time. These mornings, when nobody is around and calmness is spread over the streets of the city, I feel the best time to be lost in my world. You become your own priority. I focus on my health, self-learning, and career. I remember having this beautiful habit of not touching my mobile in the first 2 hours of the morning. I had nobody to message, and I didn't really care about what was going on on social media. Now I can again pick this up, but I need to check on the emails and some important updates. Although I think I can manage, let me see how it goes.
 
Back in the hostel days, in my 12th board exams, our principal used to come to our hostel at 4 AM to wake up all of us with his heavy voice and a stick. Like, man, it's 4 AM, it's winter, it's Nainital, and we have to study? Although we used to wake up just because of his fear, get freshened up, and go to the classrooms for the morning prep—a self-study period. Yes, it was tough, but the results paid off. Not sure about my friends, but I grabbed good numbers. So this morning habit came from there. Okay, it was forced, but it gets to your muscle memory. Although life doesn't work this way, sometimes I do wake up after 10 a.m.
 
Oh, I was talking about the beauty of this moment. Yeah, pretty pretty. I like the sunrise in the mountains. The entire sun suddenly doesn't pop up in the sky, unlike here in the cities. First, he will ask for your permission; if he can enter by sending a few beams, then a very small part of him enters. Although he doesn't care about your reply; he will then gradually walk towards playing on the gigantic football field. I like his gradual walking. It's more like my father's quiet footsteps when he enters the room where I am sleeping—gentle enough so that I don't wake up. The sun in the mountains is something else. And I can confirm that these two suns are not the same. The mountain one is more like a charming boy. Yeah, just like me. It's impossible to not fall in love with him. This one is also beautiful—the beauty that I am not finding yet, but I am sure exists.
 
Well, let's go down; mumma is calling me. Perhaps she has some work for me.
 
~Yours
