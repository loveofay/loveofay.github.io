It's so common sometimes to forget that we are humans, that we have a heart and emotions, and that we keep suppressing the feelings we are going through. Say suppressing, or maybe it's better to say not expressing your feelings.

Well, I am here talking about the attachments we make to people and the pain when it's time to say goodbye. I don't know if attachment is too selfish of a word because it's mostly about you feeling terrible when people aren't around, you not sleeping for nights, you getting nightmares of them leaving, and you absolutely missing the times you were with them. It is, I guess, a selfish emotion, but perhaps you are also important, and so are your emotions.

You were chilling around, life was good, you were happy, you were focused, and then you met some people. And boom! Gears changed.

You are now ecstatic, you love their company, you laugh around at silly jokes, you keep talking about random stuff the entire night till you listen to the sound of morning bhajans coming from neighbors, realizing that now it's seriously time to sleep, you having night outs at 1 AM when police comes to you saying go back home and you convincing them for 5mins which tends to mean 2hrs at least, you cooking together; cooking is simple but managing resources to get non-veg because apparently you are in Rajasthan and there is no non-veg shop for miles, you dancing on random chatakta music; dance? I won't call it dance; just say the fast movement of your hands and body, you having deep conversations about your insecurities and how you will raise your son; surprisingly, the nighter it gets, the deeper the conversation becomes; you fixing that one bro's relationship, which you already know is sinking but you must tell the truth without even hurting his emotions; you judging girls; that's a whole new post, you showing them mobile gallery and storytelling behind the scenes of each photo, and many more moments, which I frankly don't even remember now. Good old times.

Well, before going ahead, for the sake of simplicity, I want to categorize various kinds of attachments:

1. The attachment you build with that one personâ€”your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your one friend, your wannabe girlfriend

2. Attachments you build with the group; mostly it's boys group or boys plus 2-3 girls group because most of the girls can't rise above the jealousy with one another; I don't know; correct me if I am wrong.

Just like when a nucleus breaks, it first resists the break; when crossing the threshold energy, it breaks up and emits a huge amount of energy, and the process is called nuclear fission. Our attachments are the same. They are like forming a strong covalent bond with one another, and when it's time to break, a huge amount of pain releases. Kind of emotional pain.

I have been through this kind of attachment pain throughout my life, starting with shifting to a hostel when I was in 9th grade. The separation from family and living alone with unknowns was difficult. Well, time passes, and these unknowns become your family. You want to live with them forever. I have crazy stories with them and will share them someday. Again, time comes to say goodbye too. I remember crying during the farewell. I went outside of the auditorium hall and cried for 5 minutes in silence. I don't know if it's just me or everyone that I get too attached to the people so much that I think of them as a part of me, maybe my soul. And it takes some time to get over this. Then college happened! Again, same process. I remember writing my thoughts down in a diary about those attachments, this time with the city and a few special people. And in a month, I did get over it, thanks to the writing.

Now I know how to handle these emotions, and writing has been my mechanism to overcome them. I don't know if getting over them is the right way to deal with them or not, but accepting reality and moving on with a stronger version of yourself is.

Coming back to the types of attachments we form, I am here dealing with both types of attachments. I have both special people and special groups.

I have written about my relationship with these special people in a different file, which I won't share here because I want to keep it private. And perhaps getting over them is even tougher for me. I have this genuine question: how the hell do we make this strong bond and only realize its strength when it's about to break? Upon thinking, it's not just vibes and laughs that make it strong, but you showing an unfiltered genuine you to them, having meaningful conversations, facing difficult situations together, having the right intentions about them, genuinely caring for them, respecting them for the work they do, and over time you just become addicted to people.

Well, new people will come, and these will stay forever in my heart; that's how it happens.

This thing I have realized lately about myself is that there is so much love inside me. I am a compressed box of love. If you pinch an injection inside me, the red-red that will come out is not the blood but instead the love. I am love.

One question I often ask myself is: What type of man do these people want me to be when we ever meet again? And I have the answer to that.

Attachments, to be honest, are beautiful feelings, however painful they are. It shows the human side of ours. The side of love and care.

Let's get back to life and build ourselves up.

~Yours
