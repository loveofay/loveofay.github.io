In the midst of battling chaotic thoughts, a delusional mind, brain fog, indecisions, hard choices, emotional sabotage, or experiencing moments of ecstatic, serene peace—essentially, in every twist and turn of life—writing has consistently been my anchor, my strongest sword to find clarity. Thinking of putting out some of these reflections in public, to share this side of myself, to not get boxed in my eco chamber, and to invite others' perspectives.

Welcome to the loveofay. These words are expressions of the flourishing love inside me; that's why the name 'loveof'. Ages ago, a dear friend of mine casually referred to me as 'ay' on WhatsApp. And I loved it. So why not? Cheers to him, and hence, loveofay.

Surf around, read a bunch of writings, and let me know if you find them interesting.

~Yours
