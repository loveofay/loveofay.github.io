I often equate our journey with the rivers flowing around\
We don't know where we will be in the next moment, just like her  
We don't know with whom we will mix up, and live together,\
just like her  
We only see the possible ways to move ahead and keep going,Â without even asking what's the greater meaning of it,  
if it makes sense in the long term or not?\
The deeper friendships we have are like two rivers mixing on a single path
and flowing together in the complexities of this world,  
being together in the tough turns and in the smooth terrain,  
holding each other's hands tightly while crossing the dividing stone,  
and then coming together.\
The sense of being at that moment might be meaningless,\
but I believe it has a greater purpose, decided by him, the god.  
I feel we are the rivers mixed up together, Bhargav.  
I hope we travel more and more and more.  
Happy Birthday!!\
~Yours
